INDRA Initial Configuration Decisions for Nile
==================================================

Expert-Suggested Configuration Parameters:
-----------------------------------
HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: SUMMA
ROUTING_MODEL: mizuroute
FORCING_DATASET: ERA5
STREAM_THRESHOLD: 100
DOMAIN_DISCRETIZATION: elevation
ELEVATION_BAND_SIZE: 200
MIN_HRU_SIZE: 25
POUR_POINT_COORDS: 30.056667/31.236944
BOUNDING_BOX_COORDS: 31.74/3.40/39.37/21.86

Justification:
-------------
1. HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: SUMMA was chosen for its flexibility in representing diverse hydrological processes, which is crucial for the complex and varied Nile basin.

2. ROUTING_MODEL: mizuroute is recommended for its efficiency in large-scale river routing, suitable for the extensive Nile river system.

3. FORCING_DATASET: ERA5 is selected for its global coverage, high resolution, and reliability, which are essential for modeling the vast Nile watershed.

4. STREAM_THRESHOLD: A value of 100 (9 km2) is suggested to capture significant tributaries while avoiding excessive computational demands.

5. DOMAIN_DISCRETIZATION: Elevation-based discretization is chosen due to the Nile's significant topographic variations, from highlands to lowlands.

6. ELEVATION_BAND_SIZE: 200m bands are recommended to adequately represent the elevation gradients without over-complicating the model.

7. MIN_HRU_SIZE: 25 km2 is suggested as a balance between detailed representation and computational efficiency for this large watershed.

8. POUR_POINT_COORDS: Coordinates (30.056667/31.236944) represent Cairo, near the Nile delta, capturing most of the river system.

9. BOUNDING_BOX_COORDS: The coordinates (31.74/3.40/39.37/21.86) encompass the entire Nile basin, including all major tributaries and source regions.

These settings aim to balance model complexity, computational efficiency, and accurate representation of the Nile's unique hydrological characteristics. The large scale and diverse nature of the Nile basin necessitate careful consideration of spatial resolution and process representation.
