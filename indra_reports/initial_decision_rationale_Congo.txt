INDRA Initial Configuration Decisions for Congo
==================================================

Expert-Suggested Configuration Parameters:
-----------------------------------
HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: SUMMA
ROUTING_MODEL: mizuroute
FORCING_DATASET: ERA5
STREAM_THRESHOLD: 810
DOMAIN_DISCRETIZATION: elevation
ELEVATION_BAND_SIZE: 200
MIN_HRU_SIZE: 25
POUR_POINT_COORDS: -5.795833/12.204722
BOUNDING_BOX_COORDS: 9.83/-13.46/31.31/11.67

Justification:
-------------
1. HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: SUMMA was chosen for its flexibility and ability to represent complex hydrological processes, which is crucial for the diverse Congo basin.

2. ROUTING_MODEL: mizuroute is the only option provided and is suitable for large-scale river routing.

3. FORCING_DATASET: ERA5 was selected due to its global coverage, long-term consistency, and high spatial resolution, which is beneficial for the large and diverse Congo basin.

4. STREAM_THRESHOLD: 810 pixels (equivalent to about 6.5 km2) was chosen to capture the main river network while avoiding excessive computational demands.

5. DOMAIN_DISCRETIZATION: Elevation-based discretization was selected due to the significant topographic variations in the Congo basin, which strongly influence hydrological processes.

6. ELEVATION_BAND_SIZE: 200m bands were chosen to adequately represent the elevation gradients without creating an excessive number of HRUs.

7. MIN_HRU_SIZE: 25 km2 was selected as a balance between spatial detail and computational efficiency for this large basin.

8. POUR_POINT_COORDS: The coordinates -5.795833/12.204722 correspond to a location near Boma, close to the Congo River estuary, capturing most of the basin.

9. BOUNDING_BOX_COORDS: The coordinates 9.83/-13.46/31.31/11.67 encompass the entire Congo River basin, including all major tributaries.

These settings aim to balance computational efficiency with adequate representation of the Congo basin's complex hydrology, considering its vast size, diverse landscapes, and significant elevation gradients.
